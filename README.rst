**Keywords:** Frechet Distance, Wavelet Packet Transform, FID, Diffusion, GAN, ImageNet, FD-DINOv2, 

**Abstract:** Modern metrics for generative learning like Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and
DINOv2-Fréchet Distance (FD-DINOv2) demonstrate impressive performance.
However, they suffer from various shortcomings, like a bias towards specific generators and datasets. To address this problem, we propose the Fréchet Wavelet
Distance (FWD) as a domain-agnostic metric based on the Wavelet Packet Transform (:math:`W_p`). FWD provides a sight across a broad spectrum of frequencies in images
with a high resolution, preserving both spatial and textural aspects. Specifically,
we use (:math:`W_p`) to project generated and real images to the packet coefficient space. We
then compute the Fréchet distance with the resultant coefficients to evaluate the
quality of a generator. This metric is general-purpose and dataset-domain agnostic,
as it does not rely on any pre-trained network while being more interpretable due
to its ability to compute Fréchet distance per packet, enhancing transparency. We
conclude with an extensive evaluation of a wide variety of generators across various
datasets that the proposed FWD can generalize and improve robustness to domain
shifts and various corruptions compared to other metrics.

Installation
============

Install via pip 

.. code:: bash

   pip install pytorchfwd


Usage
=====

.. code:: bash

    python -m pytorchfwd <path to dataset> <path to generated images>

Here are the other arguments and defaults used.

.. code-block::

   python -m pytorchfwd --help
   
   usage: pytorchfwd.py [-h] [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE] [--num-processes NUM_PROCESSES] [--save-packets] [--wavelet WAVELET] [--max_level MAX_LEVEL] [--log_scale] path path
   
   positional arguments:
     path                  Path to the generated images or path to .npz statistics file.
   
   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     --batch-size          Batch size for wavelet packet transform. (default: 128)
     --num-processes       Number of multiprocess. (default: None)
     --save-packets        Save the packets as npz file. (default: False)
     --wavelet             Choice of wavelet. (default: sym5)
     --max_level           wavelet decomposition level (default: 4)
     --log_scale           Use log scaling for wavelets. (default: False)

We conduct all the experiments with `Haar` wavelet with transformation/decomposition level of `4` for `256x256` image.
In future, we plan to release the jax-version of this code.

===============

The code is built with inspiration from
`Pytorch-FID <https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid>`__. We use
`PyTorch Wavelet
Toolbox <https://github.com/v0lta/PyTorch-Wavelet-Toolbox>`__ for
Wavelet Packet Transform implementation. We recommend to have a look at
these repositories.

Testing
=======
The `tests` folder contains tests to conduct independent verification of FWD. Github workflow executes all these tests.
To run tests on your local system install `nox`, as well as this package via `pip install .`, and run

.. code-block:: sh

   nox -s test
